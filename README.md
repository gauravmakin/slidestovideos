# slidestovideos
This converts the google slides into videos. Slides snapshots are converted to video and the speaker notes are converted to audio. Please make sure not have animations in slides.

It only works on Mac OS.

First install all requirements from requirement.txt

Then install chromedriver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Install ffmpeg using brew install ffmpeg

Also, create client secret JSON configs.

It is very much a work in progress.

1. Export Notes
2. Create Audio
3. Create Screen Cast
